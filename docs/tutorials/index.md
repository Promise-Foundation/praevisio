# Tutorials: Praevisio AI Governance Lab

These hands-on tutorials turn Praevisio into a learn-by-doing AI governance lab.

Structure
- Each lesson introduces: a real standards hook (NIST AI RMF / EU AI Act / ISO 42001), a new promise in YAML, and one new type of evidence collected with an open-source tool.
- Lessons build on each other but are self-contained experiments.

Standards spine
- NIST AI RMF (Govern, Map, Measure, Manage) as the narrative spine
- EU AI Act Articles 12/19 (logging & record-keeping), 16/26 (provider/deployer obligations)
- ISO/IEC 42001:2023 (AI management system: lifecycle risk, oversight, improvement)
