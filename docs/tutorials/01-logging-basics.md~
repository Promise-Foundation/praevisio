# Tutorial 1 – Hello World: Logging & Credence

Goal
- Learn how a single promise plus a simple evidence pipeline distinguishes compliant vs violating commits.

Standards hooks
- EU AI Act Articles 12/19: logging and record keeping throughout system lifetime
- NIST AI RMF – Measure: traceability and event logging as risk information

New promise
- ID: llm-input-logging
- Statement: All LLM API calls must log input prompts.
- Threshold: credence >= 0.95 to pass

Reference promise file
- {download}`/governance/promises/llm-input-logging.yaml`

Evidence in this lesson
- Unit test verifying that LLMClient logs prompts (deterministic evidence)
- Minimal static heuristic (e.g., presence of log() near LLM call) as a weak signal

Open-source tools
- Pytest for deterministic testing

Files added in this lesson
- governance/promises/llm-input-logging.yaml – the formal promise definition used by Praevisio
- tests/ (or your project’s preferred location) – unit test ensuring prompts are logged

Example promise (YAML)
```yaml
id: llm-input-logging
version: 0.1.0
domain: /llm/observability
statement: All LLM API calls must log input prompts.
critical: true
success_criteria:
  credence_threshold: 0.95
  evidence_types:
    - procedural      # deterministic tests
    - pattern         # static signals / heuristics
parameters: {}
stake:
  credits: 0
```

Suggested steps
1) Add or verify a simple LLM client that calls your model/provider
2) Implement logging of the input prompt where the call is made
3) Write a unit test that asserts the log entry is created on every call
4) Add a minimal static heuristic (e.g., simple search for a log() call adjacent to the LLM call) and combine with the unit test result to compute a credence value

What to run
- Run unit tests: pytest
- Run Praevisio’s evaluator to compute credence for llm-input-logging (details depend on your current evaluator entrypoint)

What to look at
- A passing tutorial should yield a credence >= 0.95 for llm-input-logging
- If you create a violating branch/commit (remove a log call), credence should drop below threshold and the verdict should fail

What this teaches you
- How to express a governance requirement as a machine-checkable promise
- How to use deterministic tests and simple static signals as evidence
- How to convert evidence into a credence score and a pass/fail verdict

Next lesson
- Tutorial 2 will introduce Semgrep to replace the toy heuristic with real static analysis and combine it with tests for stronger evidence.
