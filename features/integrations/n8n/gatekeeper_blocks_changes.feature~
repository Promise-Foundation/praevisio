Feature: Repo/PR gatekeeper blocks risky changes and explains why
  As a governance engineer
  I want n8n to run Praevisio on PRs and set a required status check
  So that teams can ship fast while preventing high-risk regressions

  Background:
    Given an n8n workflow "praevisio_pr_gatekeeper" is enabled
    And a Praevisio project config exists at ".praevisio.yaml"
    And the workflow has access to run "praevisio ci-gate" inside CI
    And the workflow can post PR comments and set commit statuses

  @happy_path
  Scenario: PR passes when all required promises meet threshold
    Given a pull request "PR-101" is opened against "main"
    And the workflow receives a "pull_request.opened" webhook for "PR-101"
    When n8n checks out the PR head commit
    And n8n runs "praevisio ci-gate . --severity high --fail-on-violation --output logs/ci-gate-report.json"
    Then the command should exit with code 0
    And n8n should set the commit status "praevisio/gate" to "success"
    And n8n should post a PR comment containing "✅ GATE PASSED"
    And the PR comment should include the run id and manifest hash

  @violation
  Scenario: PR is blocked when a critical/high promise fails
    Given a pull request "PR-102" is opened against "main"
    And the workflow receives a "pull_request.synchronize" webhook for "PR-102"
    And the evaluation credence for promise "llm-input-logging" is 0.70
    When n8n runs "praevisio ci-gate . --severity high --fail-on-violation --output logs/ci-gate-report.json"
    Then the command should exit with code 1
    And n8n should set the commit status "praevisio/gate" to "failure"
    And n8n should post a PR comment containing "❌ GATE FAILED"
    And the PR comment should include:
      | field              |
      | failed_promise_id   |
      | credence            |
      | threshold           |
      | audit_path          |
      | audit_sha256        |
      | manifest_sha256     |

  @error
  Scenario: PR is blocked when Praevisio evaluation errors
    Given a pull request "PR-103" is opened against "main"
    And the workflow receives a "pull_request.opened" webhook for "PR-103"
    And the Praevisio promise file is missing
    When n8n runs "praevisio ci-gate . --severity high --fail-on-violation --output logs/ci-gate-report.json"
    Then the command should exit with code 1
    And n8n should set the commit status "praevisio/gate" to "error"
    And n8n should post a PR comment containing "❌ Evaluation error"
    And the PR comment should include an operator action "fix_missing_promise_or_config"

  @artifact_hand_off
  Scenario: Gate publishes a portable audit pack link for reviewers
    Given a pull request "PR-104" is opened against "main"
    When n8n runs the Praevisio gate successfully
    Then n8n should upload the run artifacts to an artifact store
    And n8n should include a link to the uploaded audit bundle in the PR comment
    And the link text should include "audit bundle"


@integration @n8n @praevisio @evidence @high_value
Feature: Evidence hydration imports external evidence before a Praevisio run
  As a diligence provider
  I want n8n to fetch external evidence and register it in the run manifest
  So that Praevisio decisions incorporate signals beyond the repository

  Background:
    Given an n8n workflow "praevisio_evidence_hydration" is enabled
    And the workflow can fetch evidence from "S3", "GitHub Releases", or "VDR exports"
    And the workflow can write files under ".praevisio/runs/<run_id>/evidence/"
    And Praevisio is configured to reference hydrated evidence by deterministic pointers

  @happy_path
  Scenario: Hydrate SBOM + vuln scan into the run and record provenance
    Given a run is about to start for repository "acme/app" at commit "abc123"
    And an SBOM artifact exists at "s3://acme-security/sbom/acme-app-abc123.json"
    And a vulnerability scan exists at "s3://acme-security/scans/acme-app-abc123.sarif"
    When n8n downloads the SBOM and vuln scan into the run evidence directory
    And n8n writes a provenance record for each evidence item including source URI and fetched_at timestamp
    And n8n runs "praevisio evaluate-commit . --config .praevisio.yaml --json"
    Then the Praevisio manifest should list the hydrated evidence artifacts
    And each hydrated artifact should include a SHA-256 hash
    And the audit should reference hydrated evidence by id and pointer

  @missing_external_evidence
  Scenario: Missing external evidence yields an explicit anomaly and residual increase
    Given a run is about to start for repository "acme/app" at commit "def456"
    And the expected SBOM artifact is not available
    When n8n starts the Praevisio run anyway
    Then the report should include an anomaly "missing_external_evidence"
    And the anomaly should include which evidence URI was missing
    And the decision record should include residual mass allocated to "UND"

  @tamper_detection
  Scenario: Evidence tampering after hydration is detected by hash mismatch
    Given n8n hydrated an SBOM into the run directory
    And the SBOM hash was recorded in the manifest
    When the SBOM file content is modified after hydration
    And the run is replayed or verified
    Then verification should fail
    And the output should mention "evidence hash mismatch"


@integration @n8n @praevisio @override @high_value
Feature: Override workflow creates an auditable override artifact for red decisions
  As a governance lead
  I want red decisions to require explicit approval with a signed override artifact
  So that exceptions are controlled, attributable, and reviewable

  Background:
    Given an n8n workflow "praevisio_override" is enabled
    And the workflow can create approval tasks in "Jira" or "Slack"
    And the workflow can store artifacts in immutable storage
    And Praevisio emits a decision record for each run

  @requires_approval
  Scenario: Red decision triggers an approval task and blocks deployment
    Given a Praevisio run completed with verdict "red"
    And the decision record indicates "impact: high" and "likelihood: near_certain"
    When n8n receives the "praevisio.decision.created" event
    Then n8n should create an approval task with required approver role "governance_admin"
    And n8n should block the downstream deploy job
    And n8n should attach the decision record, audit hash, and manifest hash to the approval task

  @approved_override
  Scenario: Approval produces an override artifact and unblocks deployment
    Given a Praevisio decision is "red" for run "RUN123"
    And an approver "alice" approves with rationale "time-critical hotfix"
    And an expiry is set to "7 days"
    When n8n records the override
    Then n8n should create an "override.json" artifact containing:
      | field            |
      | run_id           |
      | decision_id      |
      | approved_by      |
      | approved_at      |
      | rationale        |
      | expiry           |
      | compensating_controls |
    And the override artifact should be hash-chained and stored immutably
    And the override artifact should reference the decision record hash
    And n8n should unblock the downstream deploy job
    And the system should mark the deployment as "override_applied"

  @denied_override
  Scenario: Denial keeps deployment blocked and escalates
    Given a Praevisio decision is "red" for run "RUN124"
    When the approval task is denied by "alice"
    Then n8n should keep the downstream deploy job blocked
    And n8n should notify the on-call channel
    An
